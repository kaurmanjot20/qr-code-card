## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt about transitions in CSS while working on this project.

```css
img{
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 2rem; 
    width: 15rem;
    border-radius: 3rem;
    transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out;
}
```
```css
img:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

### Continued development

- media queries and responsiveness

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for doubts regarding flexbox properties.
- [Blackbox AI](https://www.useblackbox.io/) - This is an amazing AI chatbot from which I learnt about alternative ways to position elements in a flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept or wants to debug code.
